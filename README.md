# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
Jennifer and the SellyBy stakeholders tasked me with an additional project to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.   This program allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products.

Analysis results were complied using a large dataset of wireless products within Google Colabs and PySpark.
