# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
Jennifer and the SellyBy stakeholders tasked me with an additional project to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.   This program allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products.

Analysis results were complied using a large dataset of wireless products within Google Colabs and PySpark.

## Summary
The percentage of 5 star reviews for Vine reviews was 36.2% compared to 47% of 5 star non-vine reviews.   However there is a major difference in the number of total 5 star reviews with Vine reviews totaling 222 vs. non vine reviews which totaled 30,543.   You could say there is a slight bias towards the non-vine reviews but it is only about 10%.   An additional metric that would be interdsting to look at would be the star breakdown across the board not just 5 or above to round out the analysis.
